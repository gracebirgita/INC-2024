# INC-2024

## Description : 
This repository contains the solution to one of the problems from the INC 2024 competition which is mandatory for the ADA (Algorithm Design and Analysis) course. During the competition, I fully contributed to the C (Double Chunks) problem and received accepted status on Vjudge. The source code contains an analysis of the complexity of each line of code and the total complexity of the entire code to deepen understanding related to program efficiency.

##
## How to run the program
1. install python3 according to the device version from the following source: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/
2. Open CMD and run the following command:
python C_Double_chunks.py
3. Press enter
4. the program runs
   - input N chunks on the first line
   - input peanut bits as many as N inputted

The output obtained is a single integer representing the maximum number of double chunks you can get while satisfying the requirement.
